# Hello Everyone

- Here it was the exercise that I created a Lorem text with some buttons. Buttons have functionality to choose a word from the text which is longer than 6 characters and highlight it. with the eventListener and using some other button strike through the chosen word also.  
- Main thing was to exercise DOM and JS.
- I know that there are many other shorter ways, may be with the Regex and replace method or some other advanced techniques but for now in a short period of time it is functional and enough, I think.
