        <h3>Early life and career</h3>
        <p>
          Barış Manço was born in Üsküdar, Istanbul, Turkey on 2 January 1943.
          His mother, Rikkat Uyanık, was a famous singer in the early 1940s. His
          older brother, who was born during World War II, was named Savaş
          ("war" in Turkish) while he was named Barış ("peace" in Turkish) by
          his parents to celebrate the end of the war. At birth, he was
          additionally named Tosun Yusuf after his deceased uncle Yusuf called
          Tosun (literally: Joseph the Sturdy). However, this name was erased
          just before he attended primary school.
        </p>
        <h3>1970s</h3>
        <p>
          After the success of "Dağlar Dağlar", Manço recorded a couple of
          singles with Moğollar (The Mongols), another influential Turkish
          Anatolian rock band. He then decided to return to Turkey where he
          recorded with the reformed Kaygısızlar for a short period. In 1971,
          his early works were compiled under his first full-length album Dünden
          Bugüne, today commonly referred to as Dağlar Dağlar.
        </p>
        <h3>1980s</h3>
        <p>
          In 1981, Manço released Sözüm Meclisten Dışarı with Kurtalan Ekspres,
          containing many hit songs including "Alla Beni Pulla Beni", "Arkadaşım
          Eşek", "Gülpembe", "Halhal" and "Dönence" among others. The album
          remains as one of their most popular works and launched a boost of
          popularity for Barış Manço during the 1980s. "Arkadaşım Eşek" ("My
          Friend Donkey"), quickly grew very popular among children (the song is
          about rural nostalgia and was not initially intended as a children's
          song). Throughout his career, he went on to write many other songs
          primarily for children to achieve an iconic acceptance among Turkish
          children of the 1980s and 1990s.
        </p>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
          On 1 February 1999, Barış Manço died of a sudden heart attack before
          the release of his just finished last work Mançoloji (Mançology or
          Manchology) (1999), a double album containing the new recordings of
          his hit songs along with an unfinished instrumental song "40. Yıl"
          ("The 40th Anniversary"), celebrating his 40th year in music. His
          sudden death caused an almost unanimous shock in Turkey with millions
          of people mourning and tens of thousands of people attending his
          funeral.
        </p>
        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Barış Manço was one of the most influential Turkish musicians. In his
          early career he and his bands contributed to the Turkish rock movement
          by combining traditional Turkish music with rock influences, which is
          still one of the main trends of Turkish popular music.
